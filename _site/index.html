  <p>I really enjoyed reading Kant in high school. Yes, this suggests that I’m weird. I can live with
that. Here, I’ll collect a few of the works that resonate with me in one way or another, and try
to present them in a way that encourages deep linking and discussion. Let’s see how it goes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/what_is_enlightenment/">An Answer to the Question: “What is Enlightenment?”</a></li>
  <li><a href="/was_ist_aufklärung/">Beantwortung der Frage: “Was ist Aufklärung?”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is mostly just a good excuse to play with GitHub’s support for HTTPSifying custom domains
(yay!), but it’s also another pass at a site I’d put together years ago, inspired by @hober’s
marvelous presentation of <a href="http://federali.st">The Federalist Papers</a>.</p>
