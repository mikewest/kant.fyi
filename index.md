# kant.fyi

I really enjoyed reading Kant in high school. Yes, this suggests that I'm weird. I can live with
that. Here, I'll collect a few of the works that resonate with me in one way or another, and try
to present them in a way that encourages deep linking and discussion. Let's see how it goes.

## English

*   [An Answer to the Question: "What is Enlightenment?"](/what_is_enlightenment/)
*   [Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals](/groundwork/)

## German

*   [Beantwortung der Frage: "Was ist Aufklärung?"](/was_ist_aufklärung/)

This is mostly just a good excuse to play with GitHub's support for HTTPSifying custom domains
(yay!), but it's also another pass at a site I'd put together years ago, inspired by
[@hober](http://tess.oconnor.cx/)'s marvelous presentation of
[The Federalist Papers](http://federali.st).

All the works here are [in the public domain](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/),
and you're encouraged to poke at them in the [mikewest/kant.fyi](https://github.com/mikewest/kant.fyi/)
GitHub repo.
