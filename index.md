I really enjoyed reading Kant in high school. Yes, this suggests that I'm weird. I can live with
that. Here, I'll collect a few of the works that resonate with me in one way or another, and try
to present them in a way that encourages deep linking and discussion. Let's see how it goes.

*   [An Answer to the Question: "What is Enlightenment?"](/what_is_enlightenment/)
*   [Beantwortung der Frage: "Was ist Aufklärung?"](/was_ist_aufklärung/)

This is mostly just a good excuse to play with GitHub's support for HTTPSifying custom domains
(yay!), but it's also another pass at a site I'd put together years ago, inspired by @hober's
marvelous presentation of [The Federalist Papers](http://federali.st).
